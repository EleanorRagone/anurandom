Implementations in various languages of the Quantom Random Number Generator provided by:
- ANU Quantum Optics: http://photonics.anu.edu.au/qoptics/Research/qrng.php
- Bartek 'BaSz' Szurgot: http://www.baszerr.eu --->C++ implementation
- Goat Avenger ---> C implementation
- Caitlin 'caitelatte': http://caitelatte.com ---> Ruby implementation
- Kristian Lundkvist <kristian.lundkvist@gmail.com> --->Java implementation
- Peter Ragone ---> initialized the original master of which this is a fork


---
This project was started by pcragone quite a few years ago now.  My C implementation and a ruby implementation never made the push to pcragone's master.  So this fork remains the most complete branch so far.  If not the completion itself.
